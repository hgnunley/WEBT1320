                    <h3> Testimonials </h3>
                    <p>This is the first time that I had ever really gotten my makeup done. I had my aunt do some a couple of times but nothing big! If anyone asked me I would tell them to use Harley! She did a wonderful job! - Phoebe Foshee </p>

                    <p>It was my wedding day and I was stressing about makeup and Harley was a big help and she did a wonderful job. I would recommend her in a heart beat! - Tricia Frisbee</p>
                    <p>Harley did my makeup for a recent photoshoot. It looked flawless even without lighting! Lashes were included. Total wear time was over 12 hours, no smudging. She also met me early on a Sunday morning which I appreciated. - Connie Campbell </p>

        <h3>Foundations</h3>
        <p> "The Ordinary" Serum Foundation</p>
        <p> I purchased 7 of these foundations for myself to try and to also add to my collection to use on clients. 
            They retail for $6.70 per foundation and 7 of them came out to around $51 which is remarkable considering
            I can buy a single high-end foundation for that price. This foundation is extremely light-weight and sits nicely on the skin.
            I have tried many high end foundations such as Huda Beauty "Faux Filter", Fenty Beauty, etc. and I actually like this foundation 
            better than all of them. The Ordinary Foundation is very thin so it does not offer full coverage upon the first application but 
            it is very layerable and does not get heavy or cakey when you do so. I would suggest a good pore filling primer especially if you have large
            pores like myself because it does tend to settle in them. This foundation is all vegan and is made with Japanese super foods so if you are acne 
            prone it will help with that. I have noticed my skin clearing up while using this product.

        <h3>Eyeshadow Palettes</h3>
        <p> "Wild Greens" by Urban Decay</p>
        <p> I have used a lot of Urban Decay eyeshadow palettes and I love all of them especially the "Naked Cherry" palette so I was <b>VERY</b> excited
            to recieve this in an Influenster box. I opened it up and I want to start by saying that the packaging is absolutly stunning and so are the pigments. BUT, 
            as far as how the pigments performed I was very let down. The green vanished as soon as I started blending and so did the pink shades. I started looking closer and the pink shades actually looks almost identical to those in the Naked Cherry palette. The shimmers were nice and pretty creamy but also not a huge pay off. You could do the same look or a better look using just the Naked Cherry pallete and maybe another one if you want to use the greens but for a palette called "Wild Greens" there certainly was not alot of green included.

        <h3> Mascaras</h3>
        <p> "Wild Lash" by Urban Decay</p>
        <p> The "Wild Lash" mascara by Urban Decay was an accidental find as I recieved it free through PR with influenster.
            I have stuggle for years to find a mascara that truly works for me and with this one I believe I did. 
            The problem I have always had with mascaras is that they bleed and give me raccoon eyes because of how sensitive my eyes are. 
            "Wild Lash" did not move at all and I even had it on my bottom lash line. Because it did not budge I was thinking it would be
            hard to take off but it was the exact oppisite and came of easier than any mascara i had tried before. it didnt smear across my
            face it just simply removed with warm water on a wash cloth. They sent me a full size product but I will be repurchasing when I
            run out for the simple fact of no raccoon eyes. This products costs $26 which is not that bad for a brand as well known as Urban Decay.  </p>
