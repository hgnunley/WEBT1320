            <h1> Let's Hike! </h1>
            <P> There are tons of hiking opportunities as the South Cumberland State Park System is a large part of Grundy County. <br> 
            The Retreat at Deer Lick Falls even has its own personal waterfall within the retreat which is the second largest waterfall in the South Cumberland Park System.</P>
            <p> A great Resource to use when it comes to hiking in Grundy is the AllTrails app. Some trails here are extremely difficult and childen or anyone with health issues should not attempt them. AllTrails provides an amazing trail rating service witch lets you know if a trail is easy, moderate, hard, or extremely difficult.

            </p>
