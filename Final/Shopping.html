            <h1> Shopping!</h1>
         <p> Grundy is beautiful but shopping here is limited so google maps is going to be your best friend.</p>
         <p> We do not have a Walmart near the retreats you will be traveling around 45 minutes if you want to go to Walmart.
             We do have a Piggly Wiggly, Dollar General, CVS, and many gas stations where you should be able to find everything you need. 
         </p>
           <h3> Piggly Wiggly</h3>
           <p> The Piggly Wiggly or as we like to call it "The Pig" is located in Monteagle at <br>754 W Main St, Monteagle, TN 37356 <br>
            They supply lots of produce and even have lots of vegan options.</p>
            <h3> Dollar General</h3>
            <p> There are TWO Dollar Generals near the retreat. If you are at the retreat at Deer Lick Falls the one in monteagle at 915 W Main St, Monteagle, TN 37356 will be the nearest to you.
