                    <p> Mountain Cruisers is a non-profit organization that raises money for ThanksGiving Baskets that we give to widows throughout the county. <br> 
                    Grundy county is one of the poorest counties in the state of Tennessee and is old fashioned in the way that the male in the house is the main source of income. When the husband, etc. passes away it normally leaves the widow with nothing and prevents her from being able to supply for her family in the way that she wants to especially with age. Our ThanksGiving Baskets contain eveerything needed to host a full spread Thanksgiving Dinner. We raise money for this by hosting cruise-ins and doing raffles.<br> We also have several car shows per year where we raise money for emergency cases in the county for example we raised over $1,000 for a highschool boy with cancer last year.  </p>
