        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I started really doing makeup at around 15 years old so 8th grade. I watched tons of YouTube videos that showed me the correct way to do things and properly use color theory which is the fundamental base of makeup. After I thought I was good enough I went to the closest salon to my house which is owned by a very sweet woman who decided to let me do makeup appointments in her salon. 
        </p>
        <p> I am so Thankful for her because allowing me to do that really helped me flurish and get my name out.</p>
    
        <p>
            I later started my makeup page on Facebook which I still operate on 4 years later. I began doing makeup for my classmates for Photoshoots, Prom, etc which forced me to talk to people I would have otherwise never spoken to. This truly helped me and allowed me to be more confident.
