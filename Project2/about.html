        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I started really doing makeup at around 15 years old so 8th grade. I watched tons of YouTube videos that showed me the correct way to do things as well as color theory which is the fundamental of the art of makeup. I soon got pretty good at it and went to the closest salon to my house which is owned by a very sweet woman who decided to let me do makeup appointments in her salon. 
        </p>
        <p> I am so Thankful for her because allowing me to do that really helped me flurish and get my name out.</p>

            I soon started my makeup page on Facebook which I still operate on 4 years later. I was always extremely shy in school but when I started doing makeup I began doing makeup for my classmates for photoshoots, Prom, etc which forced me to talk to people I would have otherwise never spoken to. This truly helped me and allowed me to be more confident.

            I look back at some of the looks I did in the beginning and I cringe because when I did them I thought they were amazing but now that I've grown they don't hold up to the standard that I now hold myself at and I become embarrassed. I have to catch myself and realize that instead of being ashamed of them I should be proud because they show how much I have grown and that everyone starts somewhere.
